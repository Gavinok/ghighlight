# ghighlight

This is a groff preprocessor written in perl that will highlight your code for you. All of the syntax highlighting is done by [GNU Source-highlight](https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/#mozTocId323328) This way the highlighting can be modified and customized as needed. Currently the only macros supported are mm and ms macros.


### NOTE

This project is currently in alpha stages and still needs work before it is functional.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following programs installed:

- Perl (only tested on 5.3)
- GNU Source-highlight
- Groff


### Installing

Simply add ghighlight.pl to your PATH 

## Usage

Inside your groff file add `.SOURCE start`  and `.SOURCE stop` to start and stop a source code section. source-highlight will automatically detect the syntax based on the source code inside the block. The stop in `.SOURCE stop` is optional and can be replaced with `.SOURCE`

By default ghighlight uses black and white mode to enable color simple set the environmental `GHLENABLECOLOR=1` warning color support is still buggy.

For global use add this to your bashrc or zshrc
```sh
export GHLENABLECOLOR=1
```

For one time use 
```sh
GHLENABLECOLOR=1 && ghighlight.pl INPUTFILE.ms | groff ... > OUTPUTFILE
```

FILE.ms
```roff
.NH
This Is A Heading
.LP
this is a paragraph

.\" start source code block
.SOURCE start
#! /usr/bin/env perl

my $version = 'This is a source code block';
print $line; 
.SOURCE stop
.\" end source code block
```

```sh
ghighlight.pl FILE.ms | groff -T pdf -ms > output.pdf
```

To specify a syntax use `.SOURCE <language>`
```roff
.SOURCE c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int i = 0;
    printf("hello\n");
    return 0;
}
.SOURCE stop
```

An alternatives to `.SOURCE is .\`\`` used like so
```roff
.`` c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int i = 0;
    printf("hello\n");
    return 0;
}
.`` stop
```

if you are using ".so"-makros in your files, you must combine the files beforehand using **soelim**, e.g.:

`soelim MAIN.ms | ghighlight.pl | groff -Tpdf > MAIN.pdf`

## Todo
- [x] Toggling (color instead of bold ) (using ENV ENABLECOLORS)
- [x] Arguments to specify language in case source-highlight doesn't recognize it
- [x] Correct error messages
- [ ] Support for mom macros
